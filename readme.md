# üß† adobe rule evaluator

_During an interview with [Adobe][adobe], I was asked to express logical statements as objects, and create a function that evaluated them against a set of data. Modeling the objects was tough, but after that everything else fell into place!_

## ‚ùì question

You've most likely written logical statements in code before, like the one shown below.

```javascript
month === "August" && (day > 15 || [1, 5, 9].include(hour))
```

Now imagine you are implementing a rule builder that allows the user to create logical statements. Model the logical statements as objects, and then create a function that evaluates them against a set of data.

## ü§î assumptions

I made a few basic assumptions to bound the complexity of the problem.

First, I decided to limit my support to the following logical operators.

-   `and`
-   `or`

Additionally, I decided to support only the following comparison operators.

-   `eq`
-   `neq`
-   `gt`
-   `lt`
-   `gte`
-   `lte`
-   `inc`
-   `ninc`

And finally, I limited the input data types to `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.

## üíÄ execution

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bradgarropy/adobe-rules.git
cd adobe-rules
npm install
npm run test
```
